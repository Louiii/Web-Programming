# Web-Programming
Events website project that uses a web app (nodejs server) to make AJAX requests to an events API (http://api.eventful.com/) and render it to html. It also has an admin page which you can log into, which hashes your password and matches it with the one in the database, if the details are correct it gives your browser a cookie so you can freely use admin capabilities without logging in againg for 2 hours.
